# Automating some RPG things using Python

Yes, I get it, you dice-goblins - half of the fun of playing with a group IRL is rolling dice. But sometimes there's not enough space, or you don't have your dice at hand, or maybe you're traveling and worried about losing your dice. Being able to quickly generate dice rolls may be just the thing you need. Also, I just want to play around a bit with Python and didn't have a better idea what to do.

So for now I wrote some code generating an array of stats for D&D, toying with the random module.

After finding a meme about Shakespearean insults, I thought that would make a wonderful generator, just in case.

Also I added a new folder /trashcan - this is where my old code goes if I cut it out, and where I keep things that are not used in programs, but are nice to have - in this case the meme where the insults come from.
